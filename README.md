# Memory Game
## Overview
This repo is for the software implementation of playing the classic
game of Memory, with a twist. This software will allow a single player to count how long it takes
for him to match up all the sets. A description of the game plus the requirements of this
implementation are provided below.
## The Game
The player is presented with a 6x6 grid of buttons. The player clicks on two buttons at a time
and checks if the colors match. If they match the score and the number of turns will go up, if
they do not match only the number of turns will go up, while the score will remain the same.
